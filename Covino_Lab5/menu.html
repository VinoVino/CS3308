        <div id="Nomad-info">
        <a id="nomad-link"></a>
        <p> The Nomad's reputation is built on consistently pushing the envelope of how DH a bike can get while still remaining usable on most trails. With each iteration we nudge the travel and geometry further towards the outer limits, and each time we surprise ourselves at just how completely rideable the end result remains. The fourth generation design sees a dramatic shift to the lower-link mounted shock configuration. This is the first time that learnings from years of V10 development have translated across to one of our trail bikes </p> </div>

        <div id="Firebird-info">
        <a id="firebird-link"></a>
        <p>The Firebird is the no-compromise, Holy Grail of long travel mountain bikes – both an enduro bike that devours park runs and a technical climber that relishes huge lines and blazing descents. Building on its reputation as the bike for all-day missions on black diamond terrain, the Firebird features Phoenix DH-inspired long reach measurements combined with a 65-degree head angle to deliver unmatched stability and handling.<br><br>
        For enduro racers, the tough and light Firebird’s peerless climbing traction, descending capability and instant acceleration makes this the perfect choice for the steep courses of the Enduro World Series. For park riders, the Firebird’s long front-center and short chainstay combination provides that nimble, snappy feel that encourages bold line choices while staying fully in control at World Cup speeds. </p></div>

        <div id="Capra-info">
        <a id="capra-link"></a> 
        <p>Confidence, creativity, endurance: this G.O.A.T. will get you and it will turn you into the rider you have always aspired to be. And true to our core we keep pushing boundaries: the all new CAPRA is a full-on downhill machine crossed with the uphill performance of a trail bike. <br><br>
        For the new generation of the CAPRA we have fine-tuned our much-acclaimed Virtual 4 Link suspension system even further. We adopt the downhill principle due to the low transmission and thus create the characteristics of V4L: an off-the-top sensitivity, even more ample mid-stroke support than before and a progressive ending stroke. <br><br>
        </p></div>
        
        <div id="HD4-info">
        <a id="HD4-link"></a> 
        <p>The HD4’s reputation was defined by winning the overall team title in the Enduro World Series. Built for speed, it excels on steep terrain. While slaying the rowdiest descents may be expected of a world class enduro bike, sprinting back to the top is not. Thanks to the dw-link suspension design, cries of “That thing flies uphill” are common among the slack jawed first time riders. <br><br>
